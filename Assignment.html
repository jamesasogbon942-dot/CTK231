    <h2>Major in Creative Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        The interdisciplinary Creative Technologies major emphasizes design and practice in the integration of digital technologies and the fine arts. 
        Its curriculum includes sequences in <i>Game Design</i>, <i>Audio and Music Production</i>, and <i>Interaction/Information Technologies</i>. 
        Students will study and practice topics including digital media, sound, video, electronic music, computer graphics, animation, interactivity, 
        creative coding, immersive media, music composition, and emerging creative technologies.
    </p>

    <h3>Retention Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Students in the Audio and Music Production and Interaction/Information Technologies sequences will be allowed to continue if they maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.75 and earn a grade of C or better in all CTK courses.</li>
        <li>Students in the Game Design sequence must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 and a grade of C or better in all CTK courses.</li>
        <li>Failure to meet retention requirements may result in removal from the program.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Standards for Progress in the Major</h3>
    <p>
        Students will be allowed to continue in the Creative Technologies program if they meet retention requirements 
        and demonstrate satisfactory progress toward completion of the program.
    </p>

    <h3>Sequences in Creative Technologies</h3>

    <h4>Accelerated Creative Technologies Sequence</h4>
    <p>
        High-achieving students in Creative Technologies (CTK) with a GPA of 3.5 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence 
        prior to the end of their junior year. This sequence allows a student to earn 12 hours of graduate credit in CTK while completing their undergraduate degree.
    </p>

    <h4>Audio and Music Production Sequence</h4>
    <p>
        The Audio and Music Production sequence provides comprehensive study in sound recording, music production, and digital audio. 
        Courses cover recording techniques, audio theory, mixing, mastering, and creative audio production.
    </p>

    <h4>Game Design Sequence</h4>
    <p>
        The Game Design sequence emphasizes both the creative and technical aspects of video game design and development. 
        Students study game play mechanics, interactive storytelling, level design, user experience, and immersive technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).
    </p>

    <h4>Interaction/Information Technologies Sequence</h4>
    <p>
        This sequence emphasizes interactive and immersive media such as mobile apps, computer programming, creative coding, 
        virtual reality, augmented reality, and interactive installations. Students explore how digital technologies can be used in creative practice.
