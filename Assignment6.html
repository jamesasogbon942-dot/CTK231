      <h2>A Simple Example in Helvetica</h2>

      <p>This page was built to show how clean typography and balanced spacing can make a design feel more professional. Georgia was chosen for these paragraphs because it’s easy to read and gives the text a polished tone.</p>

      <p>The layout is centered with a soft border around it to keep everything contained. Each section flows naturally into the next, and the image below adds a touch of contrast against the white background.</p>

      <p>Links in this section are designed to stand out — bold and red by default, switching to blue with an underline when hovered. It’s a subtle but effective way to show interaction without clutter.</p>

      <p>Modern design often focuses on clarity and usability. Whether you’re building a website, portfolio, or simple landing page, typefaces like 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica" target="_blank">Helvetica</a> help create structure and consistency. Some designers, like those at 
      <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/" target="_blank">McSweeney’s</a>, use playful layouts to balance text and white space in creative ways.</p>

      <p>Good pages use hierarchy and rhythm. Bold headlines, clean paragraphs, and clear links make the experience smoother for readers. Visual details — like borders, spacing, and font choices — help everything feel connected.</p>
