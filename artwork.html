                <h3>CTK 248 Digital Painting Assignment</h3>
                <p>
                    This sketch was part of a digital painting exercise for my CTK 248 class. The goal was to practice using
                    digital tools to create expressive motion and form. I focused on capturing the action and movement of a 
                    basketball player using simple shapes and clean strokes.

                <h3>CTK 248 Narrative Digital Painting — “Dreamers” by BTS</h3>
                <p>
                    For this CTK 248 project, we created a digital painting based on an existing song, story, or poem. I chose 
                    “Dreamers” by BTS because it was the anthem for the World Cup, making it the perfect inspiration for a 
                    soccer illustration. I used previous techniques to represent movement, energy, and the uplifting message 
                    of the song.

                <h3>CTK 248 – Artist Emulation Project (Piet Mondrian)</h3>
                <p>
                    For this assignment, I selected Piet Mondrian and created an emulation of his artistic style. The goal was 
                    to study his geometric style, strong black linework, and primary color blocking, then recreate those 
                    techniques in my own digital painting. The two images at the bottom of the piece are Mondrian's original works.
